# Owen-Cyber-Journey

This repository contains programs that I am building to enhance my cyber security portfolio. The projects I add here are all personal work and are not associated with Appalachian State. Please feel free to check out my Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/owensirois/ and message me with comments or constructive criticism. I am all about learning and hope to learn lots throughout my IT and cybersescurity journey. :-)

## Documents

This folder is where all my documentation lives. Each file will have a link to the original content and my own YouTube video that I made showing off my project. The .txt files depict my process and exactly how I created the project. Feel free to read and enjoy all of my simple YouTube videos. 

## Python

This folder is where all of my Python programs live. The code is originally made in VisualStudioCode and then uploaded here. Its respective .txt file explains how I created the code and my thinking process. It also contains where I learned how to do the project and the original content I used. Feel free to use my code to create your own project!
