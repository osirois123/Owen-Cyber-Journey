Here is a simple hashing program that takes user input and converts it into a hashed string using SHA256.

This is the YouTube video that I used to help make the program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-h0CtKde6w&t=534s

Hashing is useful in cybersecurity when looking at the integrity of something. The idea of hashing is that it will take input
and convert that into a digital fingerprint that will be unique to that exact input. The slightest change in the input will
change the hash completely showing that the contents of that input has changed. This is extremely important in security so
that we can ensure that the data we send has stayed the same. It is also useful to store passwords so that if the password
cache is breached the actual plaintext passwords are not at risk. Here is how I built the program.

First I import the hashlib library so that I can access the functions inside of that library. Next I define the hash variable
so that when I call upon it, it will use the SHA256 to hash the message. The next line asks for user input so that we can
take that input and hash it. We then update the hash so that it can encode the user input that we just got. Lastly we define
a new variable to store the hash value. The .hexdigest is the function that actually hashes the input and then after we print
that hashed value. Now you can enter input and get it to output a hash. 

Hope you enjoy this simple program and analysis!
