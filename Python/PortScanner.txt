This is my text file that explains how I built the port scanner.

I used a YouTube video tutorial by HackerSploit. Link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3D8PAZV51g

A port scanner is a simple program that will tell the user what ports are open on the network during that time.
This can be used by cybersecurity profesionals to see what ports are being used and determine if they 
should be closed during that time. This allows them to see if an unauthorized user is on a port that should be
open. It can also be used on the hacker side to see what ports are available for use. Now onto how it was built.

I first import the socket library so I can use the python functions that I need. Next I define varible "s" so that when
I use that variable python knows that it is in IPv4 and we are using the TCP protocol. Next we use the timeout function
included in the socket library to set a timeout of 5 seconds. This is because some ports may take a while to generate a
response for us. After that we need to define a host and a port number. We use simple variable naming and user input 
to get these values based off of what the user inputs.

Next we start to make the actual port scanning function. We define our port scanner so that when our "s" variable
cannot connect to the port it will not display an error message but instead print "This port it closed". The else statement
will run if the port is open and display "This port is open". This simple port scanner scans only one port at a time and
will only tell you if it is open or closed. Try it yourself with your routers IP address and port 22. It should respond with
"the port is opnen" if your SSH is active.

I hope you enjoyed reading!
